# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do Not Track Polyfill ¬∑ GitHub Action

A simple GitHub Action that conditionally disables telemetry by setting opt-out environment variables for several popular vendors. It ensures your workflow respects privacy-focused settings by preemptively opting out of analytics, usage reporting, and tracking features ‚Äî if the relevant tools support them.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Adds common telemetry-related environment variables (e.g., `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `CI`, etc.)
- Helps opt out of analytics, error reporting, and tracking
- Supports most major CI-aware packages and telemetry clients

---

## üöÄ Usage

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-do-not-track-polyfill-true.yml

on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]
    workflow_dispatch:
env:
    DO_NOT_TRACK: 1
permissions:
    actions: write
    contents: write
    id-token: write
    pull-requests: write
    statuses: write
jobs:
    release:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: stephansama/actions/do-not-track-polyfill@v1

## üå± What It Does

This action sets the following environment variables by default:

| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK`       | `1`    | Industry-standard opt-out flag for analytics |
| `NO_COLOR`           | `1`    | Disables colored output (for cleaner logs)   |
| `CI`                 | `true` | Ensures packages treat the environment as CI |
| `DISABLE_TRACKING`   | `1`    | Generic opt-out flag used by some tools      |
| `TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | `1`    | Used by some telemetry clients to opt out    |

You can also customize which flags are set (see below).
