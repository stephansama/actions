A simple GitHub Action that conditionally disables telemetry by setting opt-out environment variables for several popular vendors. It ensures your workflow respects privacy-focused settings by preemptively opting out of analytics, usage reporting, and tracking features ‚Äî if the relevant tools support them.

  (e.g., `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`, etc.)
- Helps opt out of analytics, error reporting, and tracking
