A simple GitHub Action that conditionally disables telemetry by setting opt-out environment variables for several popular vendors. It ensures your workflow respects privacy-focused settings by preemptively opting out of analytics, usage reporting, and tracking features — if the relevant tools support them.

---

## ✨ Features

- Adds common telemetry-related environment variables
  (e.g., `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`, etc.)
- Helps opt out of analytics, error reporting, and tracking

---

## 🚀 Usage

Add the action to your workflow **before** any steps that might invoke telemetry aware tools

[example-do-not-track-polyfill.yml](../.github/workflows/examples/example-do-not-track-polyfill.yml)

```yaml
name: do-not-track-polyfill example
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{github.event.workflow_run.conclusion != 'success'}}
    steps:
      - uses: stephansama/actions/do-not-track-polyfill@v1
```

---

## 🌱 What It Does

This action conditionally sets additional environment
variables to disable telemetry for popular platforms such as:

- AstroJS
- Storybook
- Vercel

You can also customize which flags are set (see below).
